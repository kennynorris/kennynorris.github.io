 Canada has vast resources of hydroelectric generating capacity. In British Columbia up to 97% of electricity in a given year is generated from massive hydroelectric dams, while in Quebec this percentage is roughly 95%. While BC has huge hydro resources, a small amount of that electricity goes across the provincial border to Alberta. Alberta has historically depended on coal to generate electricity. As one of the most potent sources of greenhouse gases on our planet, the sooner all coal fired power plants are closed, the better. 

 Canada now has a country-wide carbon tax. Before the carbon tax one could imagine there being some preference among Albertans for lower cost local electricity but now with coal fired plants facing additional production costs (beyond the increasing cost of their input product) due to the carbon tax, why don't BC and Alberta engage in inter-provincial trade to take advantage of clean (and cheaper) resources? To answer this question 
 

 Each province independently operates and monitors their own grid. This has created a patchwork of different regulatory environments spanning from competitive markets to provincial monopoly utilities. 


 All net-zero scenarios are capital intensive. Before considering the substantial mobilization of risk capital for development and construction, institutional realities need to be explored to fully understand how best to target these massive long-term investments. As the price of emitting one ton of carbon increases, pressure on large industrial polluters to decarbonize increases.

 I am going to propose that a substantial opportunity exists for increasing capacity across the system by interconnecting existing networks. By integrating grid resources between neighbouring provinces, Canada can more quickly move along the path to retire coal-fired power plants and decarbonize the grid. While Canada derives a large proportion of its electricity from hydroelectric and nuclear sources, the increase in demand created increased electrification of both industry and transport will require additional capacity from generators to power the additional baseline load.

 Across Canadian provinces, there are substantial differences in emissions profiles. Historically, Alberta and Ontario have been the highest emitting provinces. However, since 2005, emission patterns in these two provinces have diverged. Emissions in Alberta have increased by 40 Mt (17%) since 2005, primarily as a result of the expansion of oil and gas operations. In contrast, Ontarioâ€™s emissions have decreased by 42 Mt (21%) since 2005, owing primarily to the closure of coal-fired electricity generation plants. 

 Discussion of whether or not additional new oil and gas operations is compatible with emissions reductions will have to wait for another post. I'm going to focus here on an opportunity to decarbonize the electricity sector by interconnecting the electricity grids of adjacent Canadian provinces. Currently, many more North-South connections between provinces and US states exists than do connections East-West in Canada. This means that while Manitoba generates nearly one hundred percent of electricity from hydroelectric sources, Saskatchewan generates a neglible amount from non-fossil fuel sources. 

 Electricity usage in all forecasted models of a net zero scenario is projected to increase. As electrification of vehicles and space and water heating increases, as will  electricity demand which will require upgrades to electricity distribution networks. 


Typical electricity usage over a 24-hour period follows a wave function, with the peak being around dinner time when people are home cooking dinner and turning lights and TVs on. The overall usage in the system then declines overnight to pick back up in the morning. To help smooth out demand when more facets of our life are electrified there are clever automation strategies that can be built into systems for EV charging or heat pump systems to, for example, take advantage of lower overnight electricity demand periods. These can help lower the stress on distribution networks, and consequently overall cost of upgrading the system. 

Unfortunately, given the huge increase needed in electrification, this won't be sufficient to meet the new demands on the system.
