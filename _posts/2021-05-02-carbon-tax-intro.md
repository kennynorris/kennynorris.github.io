In 2018, as part of its commitment to reduce emissions in the fight against climate change, Canada passed the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) which placed a charge on each tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by polluters. Currently the charge, or tax, is set at $30 per tonne and set to rise each year by $15 to $170 per tonne by 2030. 

Pollution has a cost. As evidence mounts that GHGs cause and contribute to poor health outcomes for individuals and the planet, a carbon tax quantifies this cost and acts as a mechanism to drive pollution reductions. By putting a price on carbon emissions, governments encourage  individuals and businesses to account for the amount of pollution in their consumptive and productive decisions to then adjust towards lower carbon intensive alternatives. 

Importantly, the GGPPA is a revenue neutral taxation program. This means that the government does not collect the proceeds to fund its own activities, instead the money is returned to Canadians through the tax system. The system is set up to take into account the average energy usage of a household by province, so in Saskatchewan where people drive far distances and have higher heating costs in the winter, the amount a family can expect to receive is higher than in Ontario. The benchmark for rebates has been set up such that the average middle class family in each province will receive money on net (rebate minus tax) rather than pay for the carbon tax. 

At this point it's reasonable to ask, 'If I'm just going to receive the money back as a cheque, how is this impacting what I consume?' A brief example to illustrate: suppose when you buy beer you usually purchase PBR or Miller High Life. If the price of PBR doubles while High Life stays the same, you will buy more High Life, regardless of whether or not your income has changed. The tax mechanism provides incentive to shift consumption over to the next best, and relatively cheaper, option, whether that be your individual decision to purchase an electric vehicle, or utility switching to wind powered generation rather than a coal-fired power plant for electricity.

Policy-makers prefer the carbon tax as an instrument to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as the tax imposes a cost per tonne of carbon that allows the market to determine what alternatives are financially competitive, as opposed to a policy that picks a specific substitute to replace polluting technologies. 

The carbon tax, as it is specified, also provides a predictable schedule of future costs, increasing at a constant rate of $15 per tonne per year. From a planning perspective, for both government and industry, this is considered optimal, as the price per tonne of GHGs increases, there is definitely a return on costly investment that tackles the most pollution heavy of their activities first.


What are some next steps toward strong analysis of Canada's most polluting industry? The Oil and Gas industry is responsible for 26.5% of all GHG emissions in Canada. Currently, analysis is frequently conducted using a two pronged approach to decarbonization where on the demand side (conservation measures, EE) and are considered exlcusive of supply side(technological shift, increased roll out of non-emitting sources, CCUS). With the expected path of rising prices of the carbon tax, this method of analysis is insufficient as feedback effects from one on th other will influence decarbonization path.
