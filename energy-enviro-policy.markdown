### The True Cost of Environmental Regulation, exploring the case of emissions reductions in drayage trucking at the Port of Los Angeles
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions near major ports, in 2017 the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles implemented the Clean Air Action Plan. An aggressive approach to reduce diesel emissions from drayage trucking, the hauling of containerized cargo from ports to distribution centers, barred any truck with an engine manufactured before 1994 from entering the port. State regulators point to this regulation as the cause of a large decrease in emissions. In this draft I'm beginning to explore if this regulation affected container volumes at the port diverting containers to other ports as shipping costs increase. I am also interested in how/who bears the costs of upgrading drayage trucks at the port.  Download [the PDF here](/assets/Drayage-Trucking-LA_2019.pdf).
