Ken Norris’ work explores individual connection to the physical world using both depictions of
ordinary real life spaces and self-portraits from adjacent realities. Using a wide color palette and
variety of brush strokes, his work is inspired by those times when baffling emotions and
anomalous events commingle. In ordinary everyday scenes, he considers how small details can
provide a window to a larger picture. While in self-portraits he explores the idea of multiple
realities over one.  
\
He brings varying qualities of warmth, depth, and texture to provide unambiguous historical
context to each landscape or portrait and flips this principle for self-portraits, allowing the
subjects (himself, elsewhere) to float in space. His work gives space to reflect on one’s place
within the existing order and invites viewers to consider an alternative.  
\
His work is inspired by contemporary American animation and Russian impressionist/post-
impressionist movements, adding dashes of absurdity and levity to unpretentious interpretations
of life. He’s a self taught artist with an academic background in economics and environmental
policy. He currently works in the renewable energy and electric power system industries.
