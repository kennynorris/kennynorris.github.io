Hi there. My name is Ken Norris and I explore the political economy of energy and environmental policy. I was previously a research assistant at Harvard University working on topics in energy and environmental economics. I earned my MA from the Harris School at the University of Chicago. I also spent time guiding city bike-tours and working FOH at a bar/restaurant. On this page you will find analysis (some works-in-progress) of challenges and opportunities facing society as we decarbonize our economies. 

I also post completed artworks, mostly acrylic paintings and pen/ink drawings. For fun, I also like to go on long-distance cycle tours. I'm always happy to chat about anything environmental policy/bikes/general economic policy/visual arts related.
